#Introduction to COA
We can think of this subject as having three main blocks
**1. The processor**
**2. The memory**
**3. The I/O**

The processor will comprise of two main parts:
**a) ALU **
This will contain all the circuits required for carrying out arithmetic operations in the 
processor of the CPU. 
Addition : Half adder, full adder, subtractor, ripple carry adder, carry look ahead adder.
multiplication: Booth's algorithm
Division: restoring and non restoring Division

We also study how to represent floating points and how to add floating points.
 
**b) Control Unit**
Here we will study how instructions are fetch from memory, decoded and then executed.
